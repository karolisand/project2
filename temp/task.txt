This project is to showcase an a streamlit application which uses openai agent sdk and tool usage.

Please create the following:
    1. A separate Github repo for this project. (u can name it "web-search chatbot")
    2. Create a working streamlit chatbot application which uses openai or github models platform.
    3. Update the chatbot to use https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ (it should use OpenAi agent).
    4. Install duck-duck-go search tool and allow the Agent to use this tool.
    5. The result should be a chatbot that is able to search for the information that it have context for.
    (u need instruction to use the 'web-search' tool when LLM does not have the information)

Feel free to use AI to implement this chatbot.
